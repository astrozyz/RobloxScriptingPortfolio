                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is astrozyz and I am a programmer based in the United States. I
                    specialize in ROBLOX programming and have been developing on the platform for over two and a half
                    years. During this time, I have completed a variety of systems for various contractors, ranging from
                    roleplay systems (such as cafes and hotels) to more complex systems like player abilities and
                    combat. I have a strong skillset and am able to create a wide range of systems for different needs.
                    To learn more about my past projects, current schedule, and pricing, please see the following
                    sections of this portfolio. These details will provide a deeper insight into my experience and
                    availability as a programmer.</p>

                available for programming projects around 3-4 hours per day. However, I am flexible and willing to work
                with you to find a schedule that accommodates both of our needs. If you have a project in mind, please
                don't hesitate to contact me to discuss the details and availability further. I am committed to
                delivering high-quality work and am willing to put in the extra time and effort to ensure that your
                project is a success.

                    price will be sent over, and once the full price is covered (remainder from what has already been sent), I will send over the completed project via
                    a ROBLOX place file (.rbxl). Any bugs that you encounter I will be happy to patch for you for no extra cost.
