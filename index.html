                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a 16-year-old programmer from the United States. I primarily specialize in ROBLOX programming and I have been doing so for over three years. During this time, I have completed a wide range of commissions for a wide range of people. From simpler tasks such as cafe games or chat systems to more complex and demanding tasks such as third-person gun systems and combat systems. I have a strong skill set and a ton of work experience and I am more than willing to assist you with any projects you may have. In my portfolio, you will learn a lot of information about myself, including my past experiences, my background information, how I base my prices, and my terms of service.</p>

                <span id="pricing--heading-span">I accept both USD and Robux. With Robux, you will still be paying the same amount as you would with USD, however, it is the DevEx equivalent of it in Robux. All payments will be reflected upon the time it takes to complete (hours), and how the scope or complexity of the commission. Upon receiving all the information about the project, I will send over a <b>PRICE ESTIMATE</b>. As the name suggests, this is an estimate and can be changed depending on the complexity and length of the commission. Most of the time this estimate doesn't change, however depending on factors and changes that you request this price can sometimes increase/decrease.<br></br><br><b>USD PAYMENTS:</b> With USD payments, this will be done through PayPal and <b>MUST BE SENT THROUGH FRIENDS AND FAMILY</b>. I WILL NOT accept payments that aren't sent as Friends and Family. Short-term commissions will require payment of 1/3 of the estimated price upfront. When I reach the midpoint of the commission, I will then require another payment of 1/3 to continue the commission. At this point, you may request all code that has been completed to be sent over to you. When the entire commission is complete, I will then send the final price, and you will owe the difference from what has already been paid to the final price. For Long Term commissions, I will complete small tasks in bulk, and you will be paying per system completed. The same USD rates apply, however with this, I would for example complete combat and building, then you would owe X USD, and if requested I will send over the completed system once it is complete.</br><br><b>ROBUX PAYMENTS:</b> The same payment from USD will apply to Robux payments. The Robux payment will be the DevEx equivalent of what it is worth in USD. <b>I will always prefer USD over Robux payments, as you MUST cover the tax for Robux. I will encourage anyone to DevEx the robux and send me the USD, however, if you are not able to it's okay.</b> Terms for short-term and long-term are still applicable to Robux payments, however, if you are paying via group funds, there will be a two-week delay to the project's start.</br></span>

As an independent programmer, I am committed to producing the best end product that my skillset allows me to, in a timely and efficient manner. It is worth noting that I am more of a <b>backend</b> type programmer and not so much as a front-end programmer. I will be able to program your UI's and such, however with more advanced features such as advanced particles/VFX I may struggle with these.

                    <br>
                    If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please do make sure to contact me using the Discord server linked below. I do require all commissions to be completed through said server, as it helps to separate personal messages from business messages. Once there, simply create a ticket and explain what you need. I look forward to working with you!
