                <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is astrozyz and I am a programmer based in the United States. I
                    specialize in ROBLOX programming and have been developing on the platform for over three 
                    years. During this time, I have completed a variety of systems for various contractors, ranging from
                    roleplay systems (such as cafes and hotels) to more complex systems like player abilities and
                    combat. I have a strong skillset and am able to create a wide range of systems for different needs.
                    To learn more about my past projects, current schedule, and pricing, please see the following
                    sections of this portfolio. These details will provide a deeper insight into my experience and
                    availability as a programmer.</p>

                available for programming projects around 3-4 hours per day. However, I am flexible and willing to work
                with you to find a schedule that accommodates both of our needs. If you have a project in mind, please
                don't hesitate to contact me to discuss the details and availability further. I am committed to
                delivering high-quality work and am willing to put in the extra time and effort to ensure that your
                project is a success.

                <span id="pricing--heading-span">I accept both USD and Robux. With Robux, you will still be paying the same amout as you would with USD, however it is the devex equivalent of it in Robux. All payments will be reflected upon the time it takes of completion (hours), and how the scope or complexity of the commission. Upon recieving all information of the project, I will send over a <b>PRICE ESTIMATE</b>. As the name suggests, this is an estimate and can be changed depending on the complexity and length of the commission. Most of the time this estimate doesn't change, however depending on factors and changes that you request this price can sometimes increase/decrease.<br></br><br><b>USD PAYMENTS:</b> With USD paymenets, this will be done through PayPal and <b>MUST BE SENT THROUGH FRIENDS AND FAMILY</b>. I WILL NOT accept payments that arent sent as Friends and Family. Short term commissions will require a payment of 1/3 of the estimated price upfront. When I reach the midpoint of the commission, I will then require another payment of 1/3 to continue the commission. At this point you may request all code that has been compelted to be sent over to you. When the entire commission is complete, I will then send the final price, and you will owe the differece from what has already been paid to the final price. For Long Term commissions, I will complete small tasks in bulk, and you will be paying per system completed. Same USD rates apply, however with this, I would for example complete combat and building, then you would owe X USD, and if requested I will send over the completed system once it is complete.</br><br><b>ROBUX PAYMENTS:</b> The same payment from USD will apply for Robux payments. The Robux payment will be the devex equivalent of what it is worth in USD. <b>I will always prefer USD over Robux payments, as you MUST cover tax for Robux. I will encourage anyone to DevEx the robux and send me the USD, however if you are not able to its okay.</b> Terms for short and long term are still applicable to Robux payments, however if you are paying via group funds, there will be a 2 week delay to the projects start.</br></span>
