# Background

Heyo, I am astrozyz! I am a 15 year old programmer who lives in California (Timezone PST). I have been developing on the ROBLOX platform for almost 4 years at this point, however I have started to take it seriously (actually trying to learn, not screwing around, doing commissions) for 2 years at this point. My first few commissions were making GFX, and later I switched over to what I currently do, scripting. Over the years, I have coded a wide number of games, Ranging from Cafe and Hotel games, to Roleplay and Tycoon games.

# Skillset

I speciallize in Luau, the language of Roblox. I have many hours of expirience on the platform, with many systems under my belt. I have created many, many systems and games for a wide range of players who needed them. As said in the background tab, I have created games such as Simulators, Tycoons, Cafe/Hotel games, and Military based games. I mainly specialize in short-term tasks, as that's what I get asked for the most. I usually code systems for people, such as an egg hatching system, building system, admin panels, you name it! With my skillset, I can bring your ideas to life :D

# Strengths and Weaknesses

I am no where close to being an extremely talented scripter, as I am still learning. I can complete many tasks with ease, however some topics I may struggle with depending on what you are asking for, and the difficulty. Some things that I know for a fact I will struggle with is camera manipuiation (things like freemove cameras, cutscenes), and FPS guns. 

# Past Examples

Now, I know what you're thinking

"Show us the examples already!"

Below are a few examples that I have worked on over the years. Some are old and some are recent, so take them with a grain of salt. With every commission, I strive to produce better and better end products with every job I take on.

#### Egg hatching system that allows you to hatch pets, equip them, and having a working inventory system. Most is not done as the commissioner cancelled mid-project, Walk up to the egg and press E

#### Arresting system. Only works with two players. It allows for arresting players, booking in jail, and breaking out of said jail.

#### If you don't have someone else to test it with you, here is a short video I made demonstrating what it does.

#### Sword fighting system. I started this but got lazy and never finished it. Q to equip the Katana, and left click to attack. Animations not made by me, I found them in a free model

#### Flashbang throwing system, you press E and you can flashbang other players, or yourself

#### I tried to recreate a system from the game Luigi's Mansion 3, where you can spawn and control an alternate player that you can swap inbetween

# Availability

I am usually always on my computer. I don't like coding 24/7 as I'll just end up getting burnt out and taking months off coding which will make me rusty, it has happen before. I try to code at least for 2-3 hours a day minimum, working on any commissions I have. The queue for commissions is pretty much like a first come first serve system. I work on the first jobs I get, then once that one is done I move on to the next. If you hire me for a long term commission, sometimes I will work on something small, then move to a short term job I have. On the weekdays, since it is currently summer, I pretty much got the entire day to get online and start coding, and on weekends I may be busy here and there but usually I am still on the same amount of time. When school starts, my schedule will be changed a little bit, and I may not be on all day like I currently am, but still will be on to code for at least 2 hours a day.

# Pricing

If you are coming here from a server such as Hidden Developers or RoDevs, then you may have seen my pricing sheet. This is what I try to base all my commissions on, so you will want to resort to that to check my prices as I may update that in the future and forget to update it here. I only accept payments vis PayPal, and in USD currency. I will accept forign currencies, however you are responsible for any of the conversion fees that appear. I don't accept Robux/Percentages, as percentages are risky and for Robux I don't play Roblox so I see no point in it. 

# Contact

And we've reached the end of my Portfolio. Thanks for sticking around. I am extremely active on Discord, you can reach out to me by sending me a friend request 

### astrozyz#1773

Sometimes I may accept random friend requests, but sometimes I won't since my DMS got bombed in the past. A good way to contact me is by joining Hidden Developers, as then I can look at our mutual servers and see that this is related to a roblox commissions

### discord.gg/hd

Or alternatively, you can join my commissions server, this is a new server I will be using for now on to keep track of all ongoing commissions, and to track reviews, and soon I will be regulating all commissioners to create tickets there for orginization on my end, and to remember what jobs I have

Anyways this is all I got for my portfolio. Thank you for sticking around, and I hope shortly in the future we can work together :)
